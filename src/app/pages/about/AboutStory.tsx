            I’ve never seen design as just one thing. To me, it’s the overlap of curiosity,
            problem–solving, and a love for making ideas tangible. As a kid, I’d switch easily
            between sketching portraits, tinkering with code, or rearranging something until it
            “felt right.” That mix of exploration and structure has stayed with me ever since.

            When I studied computer science, I learned how to build. When I pursued art, I learned
            how to express. And when I discovered human–computer interaction, I realized I didn’t
            have to pick — I could combine the two. That’s what led me into UX: a place where logic
            meets creativity, where systems serve people, and where details can shape trust.

            Today, I design and build digital experiences that are functional, thoughtful, and
            human. Whether it’s streamlining complex workflows, crafting design systems, or adding
            those subtle touches that make an interface feel alive, my work is guided by the same
            drive: to make technology not just usable, but meaningful.
